## Introdoction:

Nano is a small and simple text editor for use on the terminal.
    It copied the interface and key bindings of the Pico editor but
    added several missing features: undo/redo, syntax highlighting,
    line numbers, softwrapping, multiple buffers, selecting text by
    holding Shift, search-and-replace with regular expressions, and
    several other conveniences.
